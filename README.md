# ReadOrSee

This project contains code for detection of high depressive symptoms of academic students from Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), in Brazil.

We invited students to participate, voluntarily, in the study. We have sent the invitations through official social media pages of UFF, many students' groups on Facebook, and official UFF email lists. The invitation process, questionnaire, and methodology were under the approval of the UFF ethical committee, with number CAAE:89859418.1.0000.5243.

# How to use the code

Unfortunately, we can not provide access to datasets due to ethical constraints; but all neural networks weights and code will be made available. However, we can give access to embeddings for both images and texts if there are interested researchers. Just get in touch with me!

Install the module in the root repository with `pip install -e .`, and then you can use any function/class with the following code:

```Python
from readorsee import *
```
